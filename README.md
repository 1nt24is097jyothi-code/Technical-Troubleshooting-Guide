# Technical-Troubleshooting-Guide
The Technical Troubleshooting Guide is an enterprise IT troubleshooting solution designed to accelerate incident diagnosis and resolution. It enables support teams to pinpoint root causes, minimize manual analysis, and implement validated fixes efficiently.The platform uses ScaleDown technology to analyze very large error logs (10,000+ lines), compressing them by up to 85% while preserving critical information. This enables the faster identification of error patterns and the simultaneous detection of multiple related issues.

A unified knowledge base is assembled using resources from Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, and internal runbooks.Through similarity search and error pattern matching, the system suggests pretinent, previously proven solutions, even when error messages differ.Engineers interact with the system through a Slack bot that provides step-by-step trobuleshooting guidance.If an issue cannont be resolved automatically, the system generates tickets with full diagnostic contex and support escalation workflows.

An admin dashboard tracks resolution time,solution effectiveness, and productivity metrics, demonstrating clear improvements in MTTR and overall support efficiency.
